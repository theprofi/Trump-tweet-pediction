Has AG Schneiderman been extorting his targets and their lawyers for contributions? We will find out.

See Schneiderman admit he spoke with Obama about “ongoing investigations." http://t.co/9U6Jnxn45F

Why isn’t AG Schneiderman going after Democrat Jon Corzine and the $1.4 billion that is “missing?”
Amazing! AG Schneiderman sues a school w/ a 98% approval rating but doesn’t go after billion $ fraudsters all over Wall St.
I really enjoyed doing the show circuit this AM discussing lightweight AG Eric Schneiderman &amp; the terrible job he has done for NY.
Gov. Cuomo's Moreland Comm should be looking at AG Schneiderman shaking down those under investigation/ in litigation for campaign $$$

How can an Attorney General ask for campaign contributions during his evaluation of a case - a total sleazebag!
Why did lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman come to my office on numerous occasions begging for campaign contributions? Also recent asks?
Why is it that Eric Schneiderman is considered a lightweight by so many and has failed to go after Jon Corzine and big abusers for billions?
Why did failing A.G. Eric Schneiderman after years of looking file his pathetic lawsuit on a SATURDAY afternoon (unheard of)? No case!
Lightweight A.G. Eric Schneiderman who has been a total failure in office failed to report the 98% approval rating of students for courses

.@AlexSalmond is making a truly stupid mistake by forcing ugly industrial wind turbines down Scotland’s throat –he's hated for it.
If the gov't shuts down it is because Obama wants to make working Americans buy ObamaCare while businesses and gov't are exempt.
If FM @AlexSalmond needs to litter Scotland w/ ugly industrial wind turbines to gain independence he will lose! http://t.co/TqKkClY4VL
FACT – the reason why Americans have to worry about a government shutdown is because Obama refuses to pass a budget.

Likewise the primary victims of violent crimes are in the African American and Hispanic communities. These people want LAW AND ORDER now!
When it comes to violent crime and if we are going to solve the problem we must stop being so politically correct-must tell it like it is!
Sadly the overwhelming amount of violent crime in our major cities is committed by blacks and hispanics-a tough subject-must be discussed.
According to Bill O'Reilly 80% of all the shootings in New York City are blacks-if you add Hispanics that figure goes to 98%. 1% white.

The sexual abuse that is so rampant has according to generals greatly weakened our military. They have failed to stop it.
Just in—all efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failed—in fact the stoppers have become the abusers.

In other words our military has a very big problem!

I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there kept the oil! DUMB
Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so "politically correct" or we won't have a Country to run anymore!
Many generals and military leaders are now saying "I told you so!"  They say this will have big impact on military strength &amp; national sec.
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control.
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on?

What did you think of the boardroom? #CelebApprentice
George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice
George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. He’s a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice
Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of "Buseyisms"!
Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice
For you newcomers George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
“George has a real twinkle about him” says @TheRealMarilu. Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice
This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice
This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette. #CelebApprentice
George Ross could be right—@THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice
.@TraceAdkins isn’t excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice
.@THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help already… #CelebApprentice
How stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already? #CelebApprentice
I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back!
Everybody loves @bretmichaels! He’s a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees!

What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk!
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say "speak to my lawyers."
Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it!
I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning.
Great sportscaster Al Michaels a friend of mine played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National LA. He was in perfect shape!
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand!
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards!
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms legs and worse!
Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill.
"@bracybuilders: @realDonaldTrump just a playboy

"@ajbarker50: @realDonaldTrump do you try to make everything about you?"  YES!
@NextLevelStoner   Great!
You are right the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer!
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals remember the killings-maimings
I hate when the news media so afraid to offend anyone always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect".
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass
I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties.
Oh no they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t

Adam Moss editor in chief of @NYMag is quickly losing his reputation in that @NYMag has become so boring and so irrelevant.
Employees of @NYMag should have their resumes updated. It is very boring &amp; will die in the near future. How much are they losing now?
Terrible economic numbers released today. US GDP only grew 0.4% during Oct-Dec 2012 quarter http://t.co/i8pTLtCMf3 Great news for China.
...At the same time go through a worst-case scenario but keep it short.  Focus on your goal—look at the solution not the problem.
Practice positive thinking—this will keep you focused while weeding out anything that is unnecessary negative or detrimental...

Haters stop saying I went bankrupt it is not so. I never went bankrupt...
... but like many other great business people have used the laws to corporate advantage.
For the haters out of hundreds of deals or transactions I have used the bankruptcy laws 4 times in order to cut better deals.
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
... Icahn Kravis Apollo and most others--but nobody says they went bankrupt!
People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals...
... It is very effective and a commonly used business tool.
Why do the losers &amp; haters always say I wear a “wig” when they know I don’t.  Like it or not it’s all mine—just ask Barbara Walters.

Which team is your favorite?
Re Omarosa: Nasty tough or smart...or all?
Does anyone agree with Marilu that Gary while 'adorable' is a distraction?
Omarosa is very confident that the execs loved her concept &amp; presentation.
Next she says she's being set up by Omarosa to fail....is somebody confused?
What?!  LaToya is saying Omarosa is one of the nicest people she's met?
On the whole the teams seem to be working well together. No wars...yet.

Honest Omarosa: she won't backstab-she'll come at you from the front.
Which team do you think has the edge in this interactive photo experience task assignment?
My 757 is incredible-I think the teams agree on that.
Will Team Power be able to withstand Omarosa as PM? Smooth sailing is not expected.
Will Plan B miss Trace?
Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind.
Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...
Trace and his team raised an amazing amount of $.  Looks like a good season for charities.
There's definitely no love lost between Piers and Omarosa.

You have to feel bad for the Democrat Senators.  They don’t want Hagel either.  Just following Obama’s orders.
The ruling @GOP consultant class of losers like @KarlRove have no respect for the Tea Party.  They do this at their own peril!

@GjelajG  Be passionate about your work focus and never give up.
Country music star @TraceAdkins returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice.  Competing for @RedCross Trace is great!
I will be on @LateNightJimmy tonight.  Always have a good time with @jimmyfallon.  Now we know he will get high ratings tonight.
One of the reasons I assume I was inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame is that Vince McMahon and I have the all time highest ratings...
... and pay per view records with “Battle of the Billionaires” in Detroit. It was a wild day!
It is a great honor for me to be inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame. This will take place on April 6...
... at Madison Square Garden followed by a ceremony with 80000 people at MetLife Stadium Wrestlemania.
Thanks Go Angelo people are now really aware of my ties shirts and cuff links at Macy's-
.....you keep forgetting to mention the fragrance "Success"!
A certain whack job Go Angelo who doesn't have a life- spends his time hopelessly attacking me re: Macy's....
..... I wonder if Angelo has a job or is on assistance. In any event I'm sure he is a nice guy!
When employees are working at home they can never have the same cohesivness as working together as a group...
... Also if they’re at home who the hell knows what they’re doing (a second job maybe).
Now I know that Yahoo is in good hands. It took great courage for @marissamayer to take away the right of employees to work at home.

.@MarissaMayer is right to expect Yahoo employees to come to the workplace vs. working at home. She is doing a great job!
An individual whose whole career is trying to take down successful celebrities with nonsense campaigns has turned his attention to me.....
...So far he has been a complete failure at doing so. He should read The Art of the Deal and use his energy to focus on a new career.
The media is so in the tank for Obama that it is amazing—the funny thing is he can’t stand them!
Speaker John Boehner who I like should never have agreed to raise taxes because the Republicans got absolutely nothing for it!
Almost every major dealmaker has used the bankruptcy laws as a business tool...
People buy deals &amp; immediately put them into bankruptcy in order to make better deals..
.... It is a very effective &amp; commonly used business tool.

Come on goAngelo don't give up now just because your "rally" at Macy's drew only eleven people for twenty minutes! I love@ Macy's.
By popular demand I will be tweeting on the very tainted Academy Awards tonight!
I'm saying that the Tea Party perhaps by another name will soon have another big moment- and will be a major factor in victory!
Why didn't movie Lincoln use Ford's Theater for big scene instead of the stage of an unrelated theater?
Big response to my Tea Party statement-remember they were never fully energized by Romney campaign and will have far more power with time.
Republicans better start listening to and respecting the Tea Party!

IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy.
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?
Not believable that Manti Te’o was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid....

Huckabee is a nice guy but will never be able to bring in the funds so as not to cut Social Security Medicare &amp; Medicaid. I will.

The best social program by far is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader.

Our country has to come together. We have to start working with and really liking  each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore.
"@Vanderpunked: Can we drop @realDonaldTrump off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done?" I would fix it fast!
The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters "space to destroy" - another real genius!
Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?
Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
Wow 15 policemen hurt in Baltimore some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough and fast! Thugs must be stopped.

China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.
Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector

The reason Ed Schultz said nice things about me is that I’m the only Repub who won't cut Social Security etc. I’ll make America rich again!

With a stupid guy like Jonah Goldberg who uses “tweeting like a 14 year old girl” to hit me no wonder the NRO is doing so poorly. @JonahNRO
People have been forced to resign positions for far less than @JonahNRO’s “tweeting like a 14 year old girl”

If the people so violently shot down in Paris had guns at least they would have had a fighting chance.

In the end you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish.
Without passion you don't have energy without energy you have nothing. Find work that you love and the energy will be there.
If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure stop trying to balance them. Instead make your work more pleasurable.

#FlashbackFriday Just after I did my renovation in Central Park of @TrumpRink -http://t.co/TJlwPJ891H
A Clinton already defeated a Bush. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice &amp; expecting a different result.
If only Obama would treat @IsraeliPM @netanyahu with the same respect he awards tyrants. Very strange &amp; dangerous for our national security.
Obama now wants to deny due process to the police. He’ll give all constitutional rights to the terrorists but not our cops.

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
Our country is totally fractured and with our weak leadership in Washington you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
Sadly because president Obama has done such a poor job as president you won't see another black president for generations!
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite you would still be having the riots right now!
Despite having a black president the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader this would not be the case

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

Entrepreneurs: Do not view any failure as the final say for your efforts. Learn your lessons quickly then move on.
Entrepreneurs:  See yourself as victorious: Look at the solution not the problem.
Entrepreneurs: Never give up. Be tough. Apply your skills and talent but above all be tenacious.
Entrepreneurs: Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities and thinking too small can negate a lot of them.
Entrepreneurs:  Put everything you've got into what you're doing. Know  exactly what you want and go for it.  Nothing should be haphazard.

Congratulations to @spurs on their @NBA championship. Well-deserved.
If anybody else but Coore and Crenshaw designed Pinehurst they would be run out of town—(and the turtleback greens are totally unfair)!
The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly.

@MattGinellaGCSadly Matt you don't understand golf (even though you think you do).I have numerous couses that are far superior to Pinehurst
@MattGinellaGC  I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry one of the great golf courses of the World. Pinehurst not in the same league
@MattGinellaGC  My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game a dried out cow pasture. You have no clue but keep trying!
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst. Said they should be "redone"

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U.S. left. What a terrible waste of lives and money!
Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq take over the country &amp; oil and "O" will say thanks
Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close! Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral.
Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out. Actually they will take over Iraq and all of their oil. Stupid U.S.
